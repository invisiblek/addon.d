d2cm-softkeys
=============
ADDON.D script for Cyanongenmod 10.1 that enables softkeys for the Galaxy S3.

Additionally it disables the hardware keys for back and menu, and converts
the hardware key for home into a hardware key for the camera.

Long pressing the physical home key after using this script launches the camera.
Once the camera app is launched, the physical home key works as a shutter button.
